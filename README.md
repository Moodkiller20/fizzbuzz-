Write a C program fizzbuzz that prompts the user to enter an arbitrary integer:

Please enter an integer: 

fizzbuzz prints each number between 0 and the entered number on a separate line as follows:
If the number is multiple of 3, the program prints Fizz;
If the number is multiple of 5, the program prints Buzz;
If the number is multiples of both 3 and 5, the program prints FizzBuzz.

fizzbuzz must include a loop to iterate over all integers in the given range.
fizzbuzz must include a function that takes a single integer as a parameter and produces the correct output for that integer.
Use three test cases to verify the correctness of your code by entering the following numbers at the fizzbuzz prompt: -1, 5, 28.
